## Task - 2 : Timeline Extension


Subject : Request for Extension on Task Delivery

Dear Account Manager,

I hope this email finds you in good spirits. I wanted to bring your attention to a recent development in my personal life that will impact the delivery of the task we have been working on.

Due to a family emergency, I will not be able to meet the due date of the task. I understand the importance and fully aware of the significance of this task and the impact it may have on the project timeline.

However, I would like to assure you that I am dedicated to delivering a high-quality result, and I am writing to request an extension of three days to complete the task. I am confident that I will be able to deliver the task within the extended timeline, while maintaining the standards of excellence we have established.

I understand that this request may cause inconvenience, and I want to express my sincerest apologies for any trouble this may cause. I would be more than happy to discuss any questions or concerns you may have regarding this situation.

I want to thank you for your understanding during this difficult time. I am eagerly awaiting your response.



Best regards,
Md. Naushad Ahamed
